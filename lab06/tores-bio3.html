        Hi, I'm Ryan Tores. I’m an Information Management and Technology major interested in the connections between technology and language. 
        </p>
        <p>I’m a junior at Syracuse University where I’m the Director of Membership for Kappa Theta Pi and the Production Manager for Syrvivor Syracuse.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p> I’m a completionist movie lover with goals to watch everything I can. My favorite director is Robert Altman because I find his style <strong>fascinating</strong>. <br>I love to stay active, which usually includes rock climbing or pickleball, and when I’m not active I’m probably eating cereal.
