        Hi, I’m Ryan Tores. I’m an Information Management & Technology major interested in the connections between technology and language. I’m a junior at Syracuse University where I’m the Director of Membership for Kappa Theta Pi and the Production Manager for Syrvivor Syracuse. I’m a completionist movie lover with goals to watch everything I can. My favorite director is Robert Altman because I find his style fascinating. I love to stay active, which usually includes rock climbing or pickleball, and when I’m not active I’m probably eating cereal.
