    <h2>
        18 STUDENTS, 75 DAYS, 1 SYRVIVOR
    </h2>
    <p>
    Syrvivor Syracuse is a recreational organization that focuses on challenging students to test themselves socially, mentally and physically in a semester-long competition based on the CBS reality show Survivor. The mission of this organization is to uniquely provide students with a competition that will put their skills to the test, while at the same time developing new relationships and building a strong community of Syracuse Students. Syrvivor Syracuse intends to accomplish such 
    attributes through setting up competition based trials where 
    participants partake in mental and physical challenges, team building/relationship cultivation, and strategic/social gameplay.

            <p>Pre-Production</p>
            <p>Any Syracuse student may apply through the applications posted during the casting stage. Applicants invited to an interview will meet the staff, and the selected participants of the final cast will be notified shortly after.</p>

            <p>The season lasts the entirety of the semester, from the Meet & Greet on Day 1, until Finale Night when a Sole Syrvivor is decided. Contestants are split into teams, and teams that do not win immunity must vote one of their own members out. Once players merge into one team, all players vote every week, until the numbers slowly dwindle down.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Post-Production</p>
            <p>Episodes are released on the Syrvivor Syracuse YouTube channel, as well as Orange Television Network. Episodes contain the entirety of what went down, from the challenge to the vote-off to self-filmed vlogs where contestants spill all. Each episode covers at least one elimination, and sometimes more!</p>
